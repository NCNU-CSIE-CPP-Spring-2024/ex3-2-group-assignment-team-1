Please propose what we should do now.

I suggest that we list some action items:
- [ ] Accept the group assignment, join a team, and gain access to a shared repository.
- [ ] From the shared repository on GitHub.com, clone the repository down to your local machine.
- [ ] Modify the README.md.
- [ ] Edit the “Group Assignment” markdown file in your text editor.
- [ ] Save it out, stage the changes and push to the Module 3 repository.
- [ ] Create some commits.
- [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts that arise.
